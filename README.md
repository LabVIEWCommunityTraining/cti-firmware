Microcontroller firmware with simulation modes

## Building

The CTI firmware is designed to handle a myriad of target devices and toolchains. As such, a build needs to be run for a specific platform and optionally for a specific board. Optionally, firmware for a specific operating mode can be built so look in the readme for a specific platform for available options and boards.
